\arguments{
\item{day}{number of days from start of the inection - must be > 0}

\item{case_data}{data.frame of cases in outbreak so far; initially generated by outbreak_setup}

\item{net}{network from which to sample cases, in pairwise list format. Object \code{haslemere} is built into the package}

\item{prop.asym}{proportion of asymptomtaic cases (must be 0<=x<=1)}

\item{incfn}{function samples from incubation period; generated by dist_setup}

\item{delayfn}{function samples from the onset-to-hospitalisation delay; generated by dist_setup}

\item{prop.ascertain}{numeric proportion of infectious contacts ascertained by contact tracing (must be 0<=x<=1)}

\item{presymrate}{the proportion of cases with pre-onset transmission (must be 0<=x<=1)}

\item{R}{scaling factor for infection probability}

\item{quarantine}{logical whether quarantine is in effect, if TRUE then traced contacts are isolated before symptom onset}

\item{isolation}{logical whether isolation is in effect}

\item{tracing}{logical whether tracing is in effect}

\item{secondary}{logical whether secondary contact tracing is in effect}

\item{testing}{"realistic", "random" or "none"}

\item{cap_max_tests}{integer - maximum number of tests}
